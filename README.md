# wordle-hax
A script that does wordle for you

## how to use:
just copy and paste this into the url bar
you might need to re add the `javascript:`
because some browsers remove it when you paste
```
javascript:fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Genius6942/wordle-hax/main/index.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(r=>eval(r));
```
